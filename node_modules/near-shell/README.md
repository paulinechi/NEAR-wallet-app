# NEAR Shell command line interface

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nearprotocol/near-shell.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/nearprotocol/near-shell)

NEAR Shell is a Node.js application that relies on [`nearlib`](https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearlib) to generate secure keys, connect to the NEAR platform and send transactions to the network on your behalf.

> note that **Node.js version 10+** is required to run NEAR Shell

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g near-shell
```

## Usage

In command line, from directory with your project:

```bash
near <command>
```

### Commands

#### For account:
```bash
  near login                                       # logging in through NEAR protocol wallet
  near create_account <accountId>                  # create a developer account with --masterAccount(required), publicKey and initialBalance
  near state <accountId>                           # view account state
  near keys <accountId>                            # view account public keys
  near send <sender> <receiver> <amount>           # send tokens to given receiver
  near stake <accountId> <stakingKey> <amount>     # create staking transaction (stakingKey is base58 encoded)
  near delete <accountId> <beneficiaryId>          # delete an account and transfer funds to beneficiary account
```

#### For smart contract:
```bash
  near build                                       # build your smart contract
  near deploy                                      # deploy your smart contract
  near call <contractName> <methodName> [args]     # schedule smart contract call which can modify state
  near view <contractName> <methodName> [args]     # make smart contract call which can view state
  near clean                                       # clean the smart contract build locally (remove ./out )
```

#### For transactions:
```bash
  near tx-status <hash>                            # lookup transaction status by hash
```

#### Misc:

```bash
  near repl                                        # launch interactive Node.js shell with NEAR connection available to use
  near generate-key <account-id>                   # generate key
```
